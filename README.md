## Key Points

* **Two Scanning Modes**
  * Free Mode: Scans each track for 14 seconds per attempt.
  * Licensed Mode: Unlocks a 5-second scan, ideal for when you want quicker results.

* **Iteration Logic for Accuracy**
  You can set 1, 2, or 3 “listening attempts” for each song. More attempts increase the chance of consistent tags, helping avoid mismatches.

* **Metadata Field Selector**
  Click "Fields" to pick which tags update: Track, Artist, Album, Genre, Year.

* **One-Time Purchase**
  No recurring fees. Use the free mode indefinitely, or upgrade once for the faster 5-second mode.

* **Intel & Apple Silicon Builds**
  Runs on modern macOS systems, with separate installers to suit your hardware.

* **Playlist Plunderer does not guarantee a 100% accurate match for every song.** Matches depend on **metadata** database results. Requires internet connection to run recognition process. Scans ANY track format, NOT just mp3's!

* **Internal Listening Mode**
  Toggle "Audio" to scan internal system sound (e.g., via BlackHole, Soundflower) to scan for results without audio playing back from the speakers.

* **Hover Tips**
  Hover over buttons for 4-second tooltips with usage hints.

* **Serato & Rekordbox Users**
  Update/Export your updated iTunes library with clean, consistent metadata.

## User Guide
### Getting Started

#### Organizing a Playlist

First Create a playlist in iTunes Music and name it Playlist Plunderer, then drag your tracks here.

* Open iTunes (Music app) and create a playlist named “Playlist Plunderer.”
* Add Songs you want updated to this playlist.
* **Set Playlists to Sort By Number**
  This avoids updated songs reordering themselves during scanning. For best Results set to Sort By Number.

Upon finding a match the app will display each match on screen and progresses until complete. It will play a buzz alert and stop the playback when the playlist updates have been completed.

#### Set Iterations (1, 2, or 3)

* **1 Iteration:** The app listens once. If Plunderer returns consistent info, that field (e.g., artist, album) updates in iTunes.
* **2 Iterations:** The app listens at two different points in the song; consistent matches get updated fields.
* **3 Iterations:** Three listening points. If a field’s info matches in at least two attempts, it updates.

#### Metadata Field Selector

Click "Fields" to choose which metadata fields are updated or ignored: Track, Artist, Album, Genre, Year.

#### Click “Start”

* Press “Start.” The app briefly plays each song in your “Playlist Plunderer” playlist to retrieve metadata information.
* If Plunderer can’t find or confirm a match, it PRE-pends “Metadata not found” to that track’s Comments field in iTunes Music.

### Internal Listening Mode (OPTIONAL)

Click the Headphone Jack to turn ON "Internal Mode", then in your System Settings > Sound > switch BOTH your sound Output & sound Input to internal system sound (e.g., via BlackHole, Soundflower) to scan for results without audio playing back from your speakers.


### Check Updated Metadata

1. Review the newly updated track metadata — title, artist, album, year and genre.
2. If you’re a DJ, you can now export your improved iTunes library into Rekordbox or Serato or other software, with consistent metadata already in place.

## Match Not Found

For a match to be confirmed the app must consistently identify the song in the majority of iterations. Fields that don't match consistently won't be updated.

For a match to be confirmed it must consistently match for the majority of iterations or that field will not be updated. If a match is not found after multiple iterations, the Playlist Plunderer app will PREpend a "Metadata not found" comment in the comment section, keeping whatever comments you already have intact.

Each field; Track Title, Artist Name, Album, Genre and Year, must EACH match consistently for the majority of times (or iterations) the app was set to (two out of two, or both times, or if set to three iterations, it must match two out of three times). If any field does not populate consistently for the majority of iterations, that particular field will not be updated.

If Plunderer returns, "no match found" the majority of times, then the comments will be prepended with "Metadata not found" preserving any comments you already have currently written.

## Discrepancies

Discrepancies are handled by a majority rule determined by the number of iterations the app is set to. Each fields Metadata is updated in iTunes individually by the results populated by Playlist Plunderer.

Each field; Track Title, Artist Name, Album, Genre and Year, are subject to update independently, depending on how many times consistently they provide a result for that field. If a discrepancy occurs or the field does not populate in an iteration, then that particular field will not be updated.

Use this app and get your messy playlists under control!

## Serato

Updating your serato metadata with Playlist Plunderer is also simple when you have your iTunes library synced with Serato.

After running Playlist Plunderer in iTunes, simply close and exit iTunes and Serato. Re open Serato, and when it loads the iTunes library information, it will refresh the information automatically.

Now you have useful metadata information like Track Title, Artist Name, Album, Genre and the Year!

## Rekordbox

Rekordbox can also have its metadata refreshed.

If your Rekordbox is not synced with iTunes library playlists then after using Playlist Plunderer in iTunes, you have to reload the metadata for songs ALREADY existing in rekordbox crates, or playlists.

Once Rekordbox relocates the updated songs, select them, then right click and select RELOAD TAG. This will reload all the songs updated by Playlist Plunderer. Now you have useful metadata information like Track Title, Artist Name, Album, Genre and the Year!

With Playlist Plunderer 2.0, you’ll have an organized iTunes library, free of mislabeled or incomplete tags, and no monthly costs. Enjoy a simpler, more accurate music collection—without manual typing.
